# Simple Client-Server Chat Application

This is a basic implementation of a client-server chat application in Python. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server, send messages, and receive messages from other clients.

## Features

- **Server:**
  - Listens for incoming connections.
  - Handles each connected client in a separate thread.
  - Broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

- **Client:**
  - Connects to the server.
  - Sends and receives messages.
  - User-friendly interface with username input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory.
2. Run the server script:
   python server.py

Running the Client
Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory.

Run the client script:
python client.py
Enter your username when prompted.

## Usage
Connect multiple clients to the server.
Send messages from one client, and the server will broadcast them to all connected clients.
